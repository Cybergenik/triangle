For the world,

Every man, from the beginning of his life to the end, embarks
on a journey to build himself better at each moment than he
was at the last. Each man on this journey comes to recognize
that the willingness to look within himself and meaningfully
change is a necessary requisite for his strong and continuous
construction. We, the Utah Brothers of Triangle, recognize
that a man treads most steady on this journey in the company
of kinship. We each choose the Brotherhood of this Chapter
of Triangle Fraternity to be another family with which we
tread ever onward in our journey.

The Utah Brotherhood of Triangle establishes this Chapter on
Triangle's founding principle: that the virtue of our comm-
unity and the world beyond rests foremost on the high moral
character of our members and the steady bonds of friendship
and integrity each extends to another. During our time in aca-
demia, it is as much our mission to try and true our moral 
characters as it is to build upon our knowledge, wit, and 
wisdom. We hold that moral character and steady bonds of
friendship must be built with care. Neither constructs quickly
or easily. They cannot be built strong from any man furthering
his own lot, seeking recognition of his peers for his acts, or
insisting he or his community should continue evolution in iso-
lation, or not at all. True growth is unceasing, and comes only
from dedicating ourselves to assisting our Brothers in good 
deeds done for each other, our community, and the world around us.

Each of us dedicates ourselves to laying faithfully this foundation
and exemplifying the journey of betterment that every man must take. 
It is on these principles that the Utah Chapter adopts Triangle's
Cause as our own and commits to build a better world by a world
of better men.

Fraternally,

The Brotherhood of the Utah Chapter of Triangle
